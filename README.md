### About React Pesel Validator

React PESEL validtor is twin of another Pesel Validator created by me only in JS https://github.com/Belkacz/PESELFormPureJS
Idea of creating this React version was to show how much of interactivity gives as React. U can see this whan u run project and write something wrong u see alert without refreshing whole page. This options are available by state in react and custom hooks.


### How to start
first u need to install node js and npm, after this just us ur terminal 
```
npm start
```
