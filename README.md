#About React Pesel Validator
React PESEL validtor is twin of another Pesel Validator created by me only in JS https://github.com/Belkacz/PESELFormPureJS
Idea of creating this React version was to show how much of interactivity gives as React. U can see this whan u run projekt and write somthing wrong u see alert without refreshing whole page. This options are avaleble by state in react and custom hooks.


###How to start
first u need to install node js and npm, after sthis just us ur terminal 
```
npm start
```
